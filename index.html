<!-- HTML5 Boilerplate:

This html structure comes from a template known as HTML5 Boilerplate. It's a great starting point for most projects,
because it handles a lot of minutiae that can be easy to forget about. It also is the product of the combined knowledge
of some of the best front-end developers in the industry. Basically, always use HTML5 Boilerplate as your starting point.

        <!-- Charset:

        The charset tells the browser which character set to use to parse the following HTML file. There are many different character sets
        that exist, so it's important to specify which one you wrote the code using. In general, utf-8 is used, becuase it includes characters
        from tons of different languages and is really flexible.

        <!-- The Viewport Meta Tag:

        The viewport meta tag makes sure that your website uses the actual device resolution on all mobile devices. It's required
        because many mobile devices actually lie to the browser about their screen resolution when viewing web pages, which will 
        break responsive layouts. This meta tag will make sure that no longer happens.

        However, it's important to note that you only want to use the viewport meta
        tag if your site is fully responsive. If you're building a fixed-width site,
        don't use this technique, because it will break the mobile layout completely.

        Favicons are used in lots of places, from app icons, to browser tabs, so it's pretty important for your websites to have them.

            <p class="introduction-text">One way to become a better front-end developer is to create code that is less complicated. Managing complexity is a skill that is difficult to master, but there are a couple of principles you can start applying today that will have an immediate effect on the quality of your code.</p>
          
            <p class="introduction-text">This pen shows off a couple of techniques to keep your front-end code very simple and understandable. Obviously, the example ui components are extremely simple, but these principles are applicable to any number of more complicated components, such as a carousel or video player.</p>
          
            <ol class="introduction-list">
            
                <li class="introduction-list-element">Use semantic CSS classes on everything! Seriously, you have nothing to lose by adding CSS classes to every element. Even if you don't need to style a specific element right now, giving it a class can help you if you need to style it in the future.</li>
            
                <li class="introduction-list-element">Use separate classes for styling and javascript hooks. The visual style of an element and it's behavior are two different concerns - keep them separated from each other by using one set of CSS classes for styling, and another set for javascript interaction hooks. Use the prefix 'js-' for your javascript hook CSS classes.</li>
            
                <li class="introduction-list-element">Keep your markup as simple as you possibly can. Use only the elements you need, and nothing more.</li>
                <li class="introduction-list-element">Learn SASS or LESS! They add powerful features like mixins and variables, which will help you write less code, and do more with it.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <!-- IDs vs Classes:

        The decision on when to use an ID and when to use a css class is pretty easy to make - basically, always use a css class, except when you know that there will only be one element of this type on the page. Even then, you should usually use a CSS class - they're just easier to handle in terms of maintenance.

        I use an ID here only because document.getElementById is faster than document.getElementsByClassNames. 
        So, when performance is an issue, that's when you should use IDs.-->

        <!-- CDNs:

        This script tag tries to load jquery from Google's CDN. A CDN is a Content Delivery Network, and you can leverage them to serve commonly-used assets, like jQuery to your users. It's better for you to use a CDN than to host the files yourself because it saves you bandwith, and the user has a higher likelihood of having a cached version of the file from a CDN, which means your page will load a tiny bit faster.

        <!-- Scripts:

        Generally, you should include all of your script tags at the bottom of the the body tag. This means that they will be parsed last and load last. This is a good thing, because the browser renders HTML sequentially, so if your scripts are above certain HTML elements, the time it takes for your script to download and execute will affect how long it takes for the entire page to render. Putting scripts at the end of the body tag avoids this problem.
