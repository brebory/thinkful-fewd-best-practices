Thinkful FEWD Best Practices
============================

This is a project maintained by mentors for the Front End Web Development course at [Thinkful](http://thinkful.com). It's a self-demonstrating example of front-end development best practices and tips, to be used as a reference by students in the FEWD course.

## Mentors

Feel free to contribute whatever content you think would be useful. `index.html` is supposed to serve as a self-demonstrating, self-documenting example, so be clear and explicit as to why each choice is a best practice, and include links to resources whenever appropriate.

## Students

Play around with the samples, and dig in to the code and documentation. Get acclimated with all of the tools discussed here, and remember, above all else - no one learned all this in a single day. Take your time and pace yourself. You'll get there.
